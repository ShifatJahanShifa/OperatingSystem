To compile the source code, the command is:
gcc test.c -o output

To run the program, the command is:
./output

step 1: enter the row and column number of the first matrix.
step 2:	then enter the row and column number of the second matrix.
	(the matrix value will be generated by the code in increasing order for each of the two matrices starting from 1.)
step 3: in the output, generated first and second matrix will be shown
	along with the resultant matrix and execution time of the program.
